* Record is the main class.

* Initialize an object rec for class Record.


* You have to choose any of the listed 5 actions :
	1)ADD RECORD
	2)LISTS THE RECORD
	3)MODIFY THE RECORD
	4)DELETE THE RECORD
	5)EXIT


* In that class setdata function is used to adding records in the binary file named EMPLOYEE.DAT 
which was written in case 1.


* In case 2 we List all the records in file stored for that we used ios::out(which is file opened in output mode).


* In case 3 we modify the existed records in file. By creating a vector named data. We will store all the lines in file in form of string in data vector,
in which we will be checking if the given string to modify is substring of any of line in file. If we find the string is substring of a line. We will be storing 
modified string in place of original which was 's' string in code. Then we will be opening file in ios::trunc mode which makes all the previous data delete 
from EMPLOYEE.DAT file and then rewritten by strings stored in data vector to file "EMPLOYEE.DAT".


* In case 4 we delete the existing record in file. It will also follow same logic storing all lines in form of string in data1 vector but not storing the one
we want to delete and again opening the file in ios::trunc mode all the data in file would be erased. then rewritten by the strings stored in data1 vector to the
lines of file.


* Case 5 is to exit out of the loop.


* We should have to close the file after every action executed.
